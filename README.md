This sample project is based on the course [Node with React: Fullstack Web Development](https://www.udemy.com/node-with-react-fullstack-web-development/) by Stephen Grider.

The differences are:

-   PostgreSQL and knex are used instead of MongoDB;
-   The authentication is token-based and not cookie-based.

Styling ideas are taken from the course [Modern CSS for Backend Developers](https://laracasts.com/series/modern-css-for-backend-developers) from Laracasts.
